I led a team of 7 in the National Cyber League (NCL) Capture the Flag (CTF) competition, held from April 19th to April 21st. During the competition, I gained practical experience in various areas of cybersecurity, including:

- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Using publicly available tools and data to gather information.
- **Cryptography**: Decoding hidden messages to uncover critical information.
- **Password Cracking**: Attempting to break encrypted passwords.
- **Forensics**: Identifying digital evidence left by malicious actors.
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzing logs to understand and trace hacker activities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Investigating network traffic captures to determine the sequence of events.
- **Wireless Access Exploitation**: Testing and securing poorly configured wireless networks.
- **Scanning & Reconnaissance**: Detecting and tracking hacker activities through scanning.
- **Enumeration & Exploitation**: Understanding vulnerabilities by exploiting training environments and hacking tools.
- **Web Application Exploitation**: Identifying vulnerabilities in various web applications and systems.

This competition provided me with valuable hands-on experience in tackling real-world cybersecurity challenges, enhancing my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.
